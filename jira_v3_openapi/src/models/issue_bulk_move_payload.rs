It should be unique across mappings provided in the payload. If you provide multiple mappings for the same key, only one will be processed. However, the operation won't fail, so the error may be hard to track down.   *  ***Destination project*** (Required): ID or key of the project to which the issues are being moved.  *  ***Destination issueType*** (Required): ID of the issueType to which the issues are being moved.  *  ***Destination parent ID or key*** (Optional): ID or key of the issue which will become the parent of the issues being moved. Only required when the destination issueType is a subtask.
