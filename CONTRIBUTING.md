# How to contribute to Jira V3 OpenAPI or Jirust CLI crates

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in the crates**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/ilpanich/jirust-cli?tab=security-ov-file#readme).
  
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ilpanich/jirust-cli/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ilpanich/jirust-cli/issues/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report template to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**Bug report**](https://github.com/ilpanich/jirust-cli/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the crates will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [**Feature requests**](https://github.com/ilpanich/jirust-cli/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)) and start writing code.
  
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the feature.
  
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the documentation improvement.
  
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
